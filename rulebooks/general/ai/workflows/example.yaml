    name: Prepare random numbers
    description: Generate two random numbers to be used in subsequent calculations.
    instructions:
      - Generate random number between 1 and 100 and store it in variable `firstNumber`.
      - Generate random number between 1 and 200 and store it in variable `secondNumber`.
  - id: add-numbers
    name: Add numbers
    description: Calculate the sum of the two generated numbers.
    instructions:
      - Add `firstNumber` and `secondNumber` and store it in variable `addResult`.
  - id: subtract-numbers
    name: Subtract numbers
    description: Calculate the difference between the two generated numbers.
    instructions:
      - Subtract `firstNumber` from `secondNumber` and store it in variable `subResult`.
  - id: calculate-total
    name: Calculate total
    description: Multiply the addition and subtraction results to get the final total.
    instructions:
      - Multiply `addResult` and `subResult` and store it in variable `totalResult`.
